# How to compile

First clone the directory:

    git clone https://github.com/fizban007/CoffeeGPU
    
Now to build this, you need to have `cmake`, `cuda` (optional), `mpi`, and `hdf5` installed. After cloning the repo, do the following:

    cd CoffeGPU
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -Duse_cuda=1 -Duse_double=0
    make

If you instead specify `-Duse_cuda=0` then the CPU version will be compiled. `-Duse_double` controls whether to use double precision. A bunch of executables will be found under `CoffeeGPU/bin`, corresponding to different setups.

## Compilation on tigressdata or tigergpu

To compile this on `tigergpu` or `tigressdata`, use the following module load:

    module load rh/devtoolset
    module load cudatoolkit
    module load openmpi/gcc/1.10.2
    module load hdf5/gcc
    module load boost
    
Then go into the cloned repo and run this:

    cd CoffeeGPU
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake3 ..
    make

## Compilation on Ascent
    
When on `Ascent`, use the following module load:

    module load cmake/3.14.2
    module load gcc/8.1.1
    module load cuda/10.1.105
    module load spectrum-mpi/10.3.0.0-20190419
    module load hdf5/1.10.3
    module load  boost/1.66.0
    
Now go into the cloned repo:

    cd CoffeeGPU
    mkdir build
    cd build
    CC="gcc" CXX="g++" cmake ..
    make
    
The default build type is `Debug`, which is bad for performance. For production
one should use `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`. The `CC="gcc" CXX="g++"`
part seems to be needed on `Ascent` for mysterious reasons. It is not needed on
`tigressdata` or `tigergpu` or on my laptop.

To run unit tests in the `tests` directory, run `make check` in the `build`
directory. Every time you make, all the tests are compiled but not run. You'll
need to manually run them using `make check`. The first unit test
`test_stagger.cpp` should be a good indication of how to write unit tests. For
further information please look at the official documentation at
<https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md>.

## Run on Ascent
Note that in order to write data we need to use the scratch (GPFS) directories, e.g.,

    /gpfs/wolf/gen127/scratch/userid

After making the executable, go to the `bin` directory and create the configuration file `config.toml` 
(see `CoffeeGPU/config.toml.example` as an example).

For interactive job submission, first run

    bsub -P PROJID -nnodes 1 -W 60 -alloc_flags gpumps -Is $SHELL

`PROJID` should be GEN127 here, and the number of nodes can be varied (there are 6 GPUs per node).
This opens up a new shell.
Use `export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` to set OpenMP thread.
To run the code, in the folder `bin`, use the following commands:

    mkdir Data
    jsrun --smpiargs="-gpu" -n4 -a1 -c1 -g1 ./coffee
    
Here `-n` gives the number of resource sets; each resource set includes `-a` number of MPI tasks, 
`-c` number of CPU cores and `-g` number of GPUs. `--smpiargs="-gpu"` is needed in order to enable CUDA-Aware MPI.

To submit a batch job, we can use the command 
    
    bsub submit.lsf

And an example for the submit file `submit.lsf` is the following:

    #!/bin/bash
    # Begin LSF Directives
    #BSUB -P GEN127
    #BSUB -W 0:30
    #BSUB -nnodes 2
    #BSUB -alloc_flags gpumps
    #BSUB -J emwave
    #BSUB -o emwave.%J
    #BSUB -e emwave.%J

    module load cmake/3.14.2
    module load gcc/8.1.1
    module load cuda/10.1.105
    module load spectrum-mpi/10.3.0.0-20190419
    module load hdf5/1.10.3
    module load  boost/1.66.0
    mkdir Data
    jsrun --smpiargs="-gpu" -n8 -a1 -c1 -g1 ./coffee
   
# How the code is structured

At the lowest level we have a `multi_array` class that abstracts away the memory
management from the user (but provides a way to access the underlying raw
pointers). The `multi_array` always allocates a 1D chunk of memory and maps any
3D indices onto the linear memory using a Fortran-like indexing, i.e. `array(i,
j, k)` returns the element `idx = i + j * width + k * width * height`.
Communication between the device and host is done manually using
`sync_to_device()` and `sync_to_host()` functions.

A `Grid` object keeps track of the underlying grid structuring, including the
dimensions of the grid, sizes in numerical units, number of guard cells, etc.
This object is copied to the device constant memory at the start of the program.

`sim_params` holds all of the runtime parameters for the simulation. It is read
from `config.toml` at initialization, and copied to device constant memory as
well.

The `vector_field` class is basically a bundle of 3 `multi_array`s, with a
stagger structure, and has a pointer to the `Grid` object it lives on. Every
component of the `vector_field` has a `stagger`. By default all fields are
edge-centered, meaning that `E[i]` will be staggered in all directions except
`i`. The default convention is that `E` field will be edge-centered and `B`
field will be face-centered. A vector field can be initialized with a lambda
function as follows:

``` cuda
vector_field<double> f(grid);
f.initialize(0, [](double x, double y, double z){
    return x / sqrt(x * x + y * y + z * z);
});
// Now f[0] will be initialized to x/r over the entire domain
```


The `sim_data` class is a bundle of all the `vector_field`s involved in the
simulation. The data output routine should take the `sim_data` and serialize it
to HDF5.

The `sim_environment` class handles most of the initialization, including domain
decomposition and managing the parameters. All the other modules in the code
should be initialized using only `sim_environment` only, as it contains all
contextual information of any core algorithms.

The modules to be worked on will be the core field update module, the MPI
communication module, and the HDF5 output module. The `main.cpp** file will
initialize these modules sequentially, while including appropriate user files
that define initial and boundary conditions.

In order to have the ability to switch between using `float` and `double`, a
cmake flag is introduced. The code defines an alias `Scalar` which by default is
equivalent to `float`. If one adds `-Duse_double=1` when running `cmake`, then
`Scalar` will be mapped to `double` instead. Remember to rerun `make` after
changing the configuration like this.

# Examples for how to write kernels

Here is a simple example for how to write CUDA kernels. A CUDA kernel is a C
function which has a decorator `__global__`, and has to return `void`. Lets say
we defined two vector fields, and want to add them together, here is an example
of how to do that:

``` cuda
#include "cuda/constant_mem.h"

__global__ void
add_fields(const Scalar* a, const Scalar* b, Scalar* c) {
  for (int k = threadIdx.z + blockIdx.z * blockDim.z;
       k < dev_grid.dims[2];
       k += blockDim.z * gridDim.z) {
    for (int j = threadIdx.y + blockIdx.y * blockDim.y;
        j < dev_grid.dims[1];
        j += blockDim.y * gridDim.y) {
      for (int i = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
          i < dev_grid.dims[0];
          i += blockDim.x * gridDim.x) {
        size_t idx = i + j * dev_grid.dims[0]
                     + k * dev_grid.dims[0] * dev_grid.dims[1];
        c[idx] = a[idx] + b[idx];
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Of course, if you simply want to iterate over the whole array then triple loop
is overkill, but in the field solver where indices count, then this is how to do
it. We used "grid-stride loops", so that the grid sizes do not need to be exact
multiple of the block dimensions that we use to launch the kernel. `dev_grid`
lives in constant memory and holds the grid dimensions and deltas that we
specify. In the kernel parameters, notice we use `const` to specify input arrays
and no `const` for output arrays.

To invoke the kernel, you should use:
``` cuda
vector_field<Scalar> a(grid), b(grid), c(grid);
a.assign(1.0);
b.assign(2.0);

dim3 gridSize(16, 16, 16);
dim3 blockSize(8, 8, 8);
add_fields<<<gridSize, blockSize>>>(a.dev_ptr(0), b.dev_ptr(0), c.dev_ptr(0));
add_fields<<<gridSize, blockSize>>>(a.dev_ptr(1), b.dev_ptr(1), c.dev_ptr(1));
add_fields<<<gridSize, blockSize>>>(a.dev_ptr(2), b.dev_ptr(2), c.dev_ptr(2));
// Now all components of c will be equal to 3
```
